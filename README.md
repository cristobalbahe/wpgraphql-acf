# WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields (BETA)

This plugin is a complete re-architecture of WPGraphQL for ACF found at (https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf).

## BETA SOFTWARE NOTICE

This plugin is a beta. We're still iterating and might cause more breaking changes as we push toward a stable release.

## IMPORTANT: Upgrading from the previous version of WPGraphQL for ACF

This plugin solves the same problems as the predecessor but is a complete re-architecture and is considered a completely new plugin.

Until we have a more in-depth upgrade guide, we recommend using this on new projects or testing very thoroughly in stage environments.

Updating from the previous plugin will most certainly require your client applications to modify some queries as the Schema generated from this plugin has non-compatible changes with the predecessor plugin.

We plan to release a more detailed upgrade guide, but until then, upgrade at your own risk.

## Install and Activate

The best way to get the latest version of the plugin, for now, is to download the .zip from the releases page.
