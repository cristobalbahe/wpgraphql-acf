=== Description ===

WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that exposes ACF Field
Groups and Fields to the WPGraphQL Schema, allowing developers to access data managed by ACF using
GraphQL Queries and Fragments.

= Create your ACF Field Groups =

Create your ACF Field Groups and Fields, the same way you normally would, using the ACF User
Interface, registering your fields with PHP or using ACF local-json. Each field group and the
fields within it can be configured to "Show in GraphQL".

= Query your fields with GraphQL =

Once your field groups and fields have been configured to "Show in GraphQL", they will be available
in the GraphQL Schema and ready for querying!

= Supported Field Types =

WPGraphQL for ACF provides support for most built-in field types of ACF (free & PRO) and also has
support for most field types from ACF Extended (free & PRO).
